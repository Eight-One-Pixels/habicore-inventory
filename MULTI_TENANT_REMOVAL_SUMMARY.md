# Multi-Tenant Removal Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to remove multi-tenant support from the Habicore POS system while keeping the database schema intact.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Authentication System
- **File**: `backend/src/types/authRequest.ts`
  - Removed `organizationId` and `organizationSlug` from user context
  - Simplified AuthRequest interface to only include basic user fields

- **File**: `backend/src/routes/auth.ts`
  - Removed organization-scoped login endpoint (`/login/:orgSlug`)
  - Simplified JWT token to exclude organization context
  - Kept only the standard `/login` endpoint

### 2. Route Filtering
- **Automated removal** of organization filtering across all route files:
  - Removed `const organizationId = req.user?.organizationId;` declarations
  - Removed `organizationId: organizationId` from WHERE clauses
  - Affected files: `manufacturing.ts`, and other route files

### 3. Settings Routes
- **File**: `backend/src/routes/settings.ts`
  - Replaced organization-specific currency endpoints (`/organization/:orgId/currency`) with global endpoints (`/currency`)
  - Removed organization-specific settings logic
  - Simplified to use only global settings table

### 4. Server Configuration
- **File**: `backend/src/index.ts`
  - Removed sudo routes registration
  - Removed sudo-related imports
  - Cleaned up server startup messages

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Authentication Store
- **File**: `frontend/src/stores/authStore.ts`
  - Removed `Organization` interface and organization state
  - Removed `orgSlug` parameter from login function
  - Simplified login to use only `/api/auth/login` endpoint
  - Removed organization-related methods (`setOrganization`)

### 2. Application Routing
- **File**: `frontend/src/App.tsx`
  - Removed all sudo dashboard routes (`/sudo/*`)
  - Removed all organization-specific routes (`/org/*`)
  - Removed multi-tenant routing logic
  - Simplified to single-tenant routing structure
  - Removed imports for sudo and organization components

### 3. Settings Components
- **File**: `frontend/src/modules/settings/components/CurrencySettings.tsx`
  - Removed `organizationId` prop and related logic
  - Changed API endpoints from organization-specific to global
  - Updated API calls: `/api/settings/organization/${orgId}/currency` â†’ `/api/settings/currency`
  - Removed organization-specific UI text and indicators

## What Was Kept

### Database Schema
- **All database tables remain intact** including:
  - `organizations` table
  - `organizationId` foreign key columns in all tables
  - Organization-related constraint indexes
  - Subscription and feature toggle tables

### Sudo System
- **Sudo routes and middleware** remain in codebase but are not registered
- **Sudo frontend components** remain in codebase but are not accessible
- **Sudo authentication** remains implemented but unused

## Impact

### Positive Changes
1. **Simplified Authentication**: Single login endpoint, no organization context in JWT
2. **Simplified Frontend Routing**: Single-tenant URL structure
3. **Simplified API Calls**: No organization filtering in backend queries
4. **Reduced Complexity**: Removed multi-tenant logic throughout the application

### Database Compatibility
1. **Schema Preserved**: All organization-related tables and columns remain
2. **Data Intact**: Existing organization data is preserved
3. **Future Flexibility**: Multi-tenant support can be re-enabled by reversing these changes

## Testing Required

1. **Authentication**: Verify login works without organization context
2. **API Endpoints**: Test all endpoints work without organization filtering
3. **Settings**: Verify currency and other settings use global scope
4. **Frontend Navigation**: Ensure all pages accessible via simplified routes
5. **Data Access**: Verify all data is accessible across the single-tenant system

## Re-enabling Multi-Tenancy

To re-enable multi-tenant support in the future:
1. Restore the changes documented in this file
2. Re-register sudo routes in `backend/src/index.ts`
3. Add organization filtering back to route WHERE clauses
4. Restore organization context in authentication
5. Add organization-specific routing back to frontend

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/src/types/authRequest.ts`
- `backend/src/routes/auth.ts`
- `backend/src/routes/settings.ts`
- `backend/src/routes/manufacturing.ts` (automated)
- `backend/src/index.ts`

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/stores/authStore.ts`
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`
- `frontend/src/modules/settings/components/CurrencySettings.tsx`

### Database
- **No changes made** - schema preserved for future compatibility
