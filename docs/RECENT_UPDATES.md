# Latest Session: Product Schema & Manufacturing Documentation Enhancement

## ðŸ“‹ Manufacturing & BOM System Enhancement

### Product Schema Validation & Updates
- âœ… **Product Model Comprehensive Update**
  - Added `availableQuantities`: Tracks available units for raw materials
  - Added `unitCost`: Cost per measurement unit for raw materials  
  - Added `stockType`: Differentiates RAW_MATERIAL vs FINISHED_GOODS
  - Added `measurementType/Value`: Handles unit measurements (kg, liters, etc.)
